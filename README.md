# Payment Gateway Integration
Worked on a static HTML, CSS and JS website and integrated a payment gateway using Razorpay.


Payment Gateway Integration Task

◇ Created a simple website where payment gateway is integrated.
◇ There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking
the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where
user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g.
credit card, Paypal, etc.
◇ Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and
email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The
invoice will contain the amount.
